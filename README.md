## Live Demo
Check out the live app [here](https://pig-game-js-v2.netlify.app/).

## How to Play
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.

if the player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row on any of the dice. After that, it's the next player's turn.

The first player to reach Winner score entered by user on GLOBAL score wins the game.
