# Pig-Game

## Live Demo
Check out the live app [here](https://pig-game-js-v2.netlify.app/).

## How to Play
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

* In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.

* if the player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

* A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row on any of the dice. After that, it's the next player's turn.

* The first player to reach Winner score entered by user on GLOBAL score wins the game.
